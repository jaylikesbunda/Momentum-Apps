## Known Bugs
1. Clicking a category in the app catalog results in an "Out of Memory" error.
   - This issue has been addressed, but it may still occur. If it does, restart the app.
2. The app file is corrupted.
   - This is likely due to an error parsing the data. Restart the app and wait until the green LED light turns off after downloading the app before exiting the view. If this happens more than three times, the current version of FlipStore may not be able to download that app successfully.
3. The app is frozen on the "Installing", "Loading", or "Receiving data" screen. 
   - If it there LED is not on and it's been more than 5 seconds, restart your Flipper Zero with the devboard plugged in.
